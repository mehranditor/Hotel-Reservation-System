# Hotel-Reservation-System
Providing a fully integrated system that allows administrators to manage services, handle special offers and track maintenance requests, while allowing customers to book rooms, manage reservations and leave reviews


#Project problems
Integration between different components such as reservation management, payments and customer reviews was a significant challenge. Managing relationships between entities such as customers, rooms and special offers required careful database design to maintain data integrity and prevent data duplication. Additionally, triggers to send notifications based on events such as low-rating reviews or booking cancellations were complex to implement and required careful testing. Additionally, properly managing multi-step processes like payment was another challenge
